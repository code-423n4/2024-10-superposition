# Additional context

## Main invariants

The functionality should be reasonably similar to Uniswap's.


‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
1. Discrepancy with Uniswap in an end to end environment
2. Fee taking isn't correct. Full ticks aren't correct

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

Operator, emergency council, ownership NFTs

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ using the template belowüëá

| Role                                | Description                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Owner                          | Has superpowers                |
| Administrator                             | Can change fees                       |

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts:

Concentrated liquidity math

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Running tests

It's difficult to build the contract on its own, so it's best to simply run ./tests.sh inside the pkg directory.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ using the template belowüëá

```bash
git clone https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-arbitrum
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd governance
foundryup
make install
make build
make sc-election-test
```
To run code coverage
```bash
make coverage
```
To run gas benchmarks
```bash
make gas
```

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Add a screenshot of your terminal showing the gas report
