trying to run the test, and I get this error,   cargo test
warning: patch for `alloy-primitives` uses the features mechanism. default-features and features will not take effect because the patch dependency does not support this mechanism
error: failed to resolve patches for `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`

[10/24/2024 17:45] aerialraider

Hello @bayge CC: @Jay | C4 are there supposed to be some solidity files in this competition.  Because the submission page indicates that sol files are included as depicted in screen dump attached. But I do not see any solidity files in the competition.

**🚨 AUDIT ALERT**

@🐺Wardens The **Superposition** audit is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: The sponsor team and judge will review the findings over the next couple of weeks.


[11/02/2024 08:00] bayge
you have a nonstandard environment and your issue lies with the rest of the rust toolchain unfortunately. i wish we could help, but if you're having issues with cargo not knowing how to pull git repositories that's another story 😦


[11/02/2024 12:09] aerialraider
How do you know i have a non standard environment? I used Linux... And i pulled the repo fine


[11/02/2024 12:10] aerialraider
And the contest is over, and now you respond


[11/03/2024 05:10] bayge
with a linux host or the wsl environment?
